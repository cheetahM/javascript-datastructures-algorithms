# DivideAndnConquer
    * use Divide and Conquer design paradigm to solve the problem
    * Step 1: Divide the problem into subproblems
    * Step 2: Conquer with solving subproblems with recrusive calls
    * Step 3: Using merge routine, accumulate the solution for subproblems to solve original problem

# Time Complexity
    * We are relying on mergeSort to solve the problem
    * Time complexity is nlogn.
