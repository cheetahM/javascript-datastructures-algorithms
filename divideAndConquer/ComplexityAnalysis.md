## Divide And Conquer
    * use Divide and Conquer design paradigm to solve the problem
    * We are relying on ***mergeSort*** to solve the problem
    * Step 1: Divide the problem into subproblems
    * Step 2: Conquer with solving subproblems with recursive calls
    * Step 3: Using merge routine, accumulate the solution for subproblems to solve original problem

## Time Complexity
    * Time complexity is ***nlogn***.
